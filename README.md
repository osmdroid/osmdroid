## Building from source and using the aar in your app
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/chrisdoyle/gradle-fury">Gradle Fury</a>, this publishes the artifacts to mavenLocal.

```
./gradlew clean install
```

In **your** root `build.gradle` file, add mavenLocal() if not present.
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
            mavenCentral()
            mavenLocal()    //add this if it's missing
    }
}

```

Then in your APK or AAR project that needs osmdroid. Future readers: you may have to update the version numbers to match the source. Hint: the version number is defined in osmdroid gradle.properties file, key = pom.version.

```
    compile 'org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:5.5-SNAPSHOT:debug@aar'
```
