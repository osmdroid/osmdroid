# osmdroid [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/osmdroid/osmdroid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/osmdroid/osmdroid) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.osmdroid/osmdroid-android/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.osmdroid/osmdroid-android) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-osmdroid-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/279) [![SourceSpy Dashboard](https://sourcespy.com/shield.svg)](https://sourcespy.com/github/osmdroidosmdroid/)

osmdroid is a (almost) full/free replacement for Android's MapView (v1 API) class. It also includes a modular tile provider system with support for numerous online and offline tile sources and overlay support with built-in overlays for plotting icons, tracking location, and drawing shapes.

Current Release: **6.1.20 Aug 18, 2024**

Current Development version: 6.1.21-SNAPSHOT

Next Release Version (planned): 6.1.21

Note: check your calendar, it may take up to a few days for all global mirrors to update.

Please read the [osmdroid wiki](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/wiki) for  tutorials on integration.

**Gradle dependency**
```groovy
repositories {
        mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:<VERSION>'
}
```

Be sure to replace `<VERSION>` with the last release version above.


**Maven dependency**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.osmdroid</groupId>
  <artifactId>osmdroid-android</artifactId>
  <version><VERSION></version>
  <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

**Platform or API Level (API level 8 = Platform 2.2)**

Note: this just assumes you need just osmdroid-android. Other modules require higher min SDK levels.

```xml
<platform>8</platform>
```
You can also [compile osmdroid from source](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/wiki/How-to-build-osmdroid-from-source) or [download the dependency directly from OSS](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/osmdroid/osmdroid-android/) or [download the distribution package](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/releases)

## Want the latest and greatest?

We periodically publish snapshots to maven central. 
If you're interesting in trying it out, using the following:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven{
        url  'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
        name 'OSS-Sonatype'
    }
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT:debug@aar'
}
```

Use at your own risk though, it may not be stable or may have bugs or performance issues.
If you run across any, please report them.

In case gradle doesn't resolve it, it can be download manually here:
https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/snapshots/content/org/osmdroid/osmdroid-android/<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT/osmdroid-android-<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT.aar

Side note: gradle's cached dependencies and doesn't really handle snapshot very well.
To force gradle to update snapshots on every build, try adding this to your root `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
allprojects  {
  // forces all changing dependencies (i.e. SNAPSHOTs) to automagicially download
    configurations.all {
        resolutionStrategy {
            cacheChangingModulesFor 0, 'seconds'
    }
}
```

You can also build your project using the gradle option `--refreshDependencies`

## OK now what?

## Building from source for editing osmdroid 

JDK11+ is required
Gradle 7.4.2 is what we are currently using
Android Studio Bumblebee
(latest supported configuration as of May 2022)

```
./gradlew clean build
```

Then you can install and test the app using normal command line utils.

Or just open Android studio.

## Building from source and using the aar's in your app

JDK11+ is required
Gradle 7.4.2 is what we are currently using
(latest supported configuration as of May 2022)

We recommend building from the command line.


```
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
```

In **your** root `build.gradle` file, add mavenLocal() if not present.
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
            mavenCentral()
            mavenLocal()    //add this if it's missing
    }
}

```

Then in your APK or AAR project that needs osmdroid.

```
    implementation 'org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT:debug@aar'
```
Where VERSION is the version listed as the value for `pom.version` in osmdroid's `gradle.properties`. Note that when using the release versions from Maven Central, drop the `:debug@aar` part. When using a "release" version that you build locally with gradle, you'll need `:debug@aar` instead.


# Support

osmdroid is entirely community supported. There is no corporate sponsorship. No full time employees, no paid employees.
It's all volunteer support, if that. If you see a problem, feel free to report, fix it and open a pull request. 
You have access to 100% of the source code. Maps are **hard** to get right and this library isn't perfect.

Please don't complain about slow response times or lack of support. You will be banned. No warnings, no second chances.

We do NOT provide map data, map tiles, imagery, etc. That is all provided by a map tile ~~source~~ that you select or that you provide.
Please don't complain about a map source showing you the wrong data. It's not the fault of this library.
