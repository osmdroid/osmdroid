#summary How to include OSMBonusPack in your project.

= Introduction =
First of all, you must include osmdroid in your Android project. 
Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/ osmdroid] documentation. 
Take care to put osmdroid.jar in a "libs" directory. 

Done? OK. So, there are 2 ways to include OSMBonusPack, each one with pros and cons:
  * Include osmbonuspack.jar => simple, but you will not be able to use included resources, you will have to put them in your project. 
  * Set-up OSMBonusPack as an Android library project in your Eclipse workspace => more complex, but default resources can be used. 


= Including osmbonuspack.jar =
Assuming you are using Eclipse. 
Download the latest version of osmbonuspack.jar
Copy it in the "libs" directory of your project, with osmdroid.jar. 
Right-Click on the project, "Configure Build Path", "Add Jar". 
It's added to the "Referenced Libraries". 

If you want to use the default resources, download and copy in your project resources the following files:
  * drawable/bubble_default.png
  * layout/bubble_default.xml


= Set-up OSMBonusPack as an Android library project = 
Download the zip file of the OSMBonusPack Eclipse project. 
Unzip it and import it as a new Eclipse project.
