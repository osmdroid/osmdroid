To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.

It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user&apos;s preference.

There *are* cases where you might need to use `dp`; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size. This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container. Note however that this means that the user&apos;s font size settings are not respected, so consider adjusting the layout itself to be more flexible."

NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it&apos;s currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.

Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.

For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. *NOTE*: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add *both* the older left/right attributes *as well as* the new start/right attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.

(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask. Therefore, you can use `gravity=&quot;start&quot;` rather than `gravity=&quot;left|start&quot;`.)"
